The **SNP patterns** are **haplotypes** of **individuals**. Each **haplotype** is a **string** of **0s** and **1s**. The **length** of the **haplotype** is the **number of SNPs**.\n",

    "[PLINK](https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink/1.9/) is a free, open-source whole genome association analysis toolset, designed to perform a range of basic, large-scale analyses in a computationally efficient manner. The focus of PLINK is purely on analysis of genotype/phenotype data, so there is no support for a file format for storing sequence data or working with the sequence data directly.\n",
